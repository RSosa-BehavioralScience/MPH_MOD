Open and run the R scripts according to their numbering; always run in that order. 

Do not run the same script twice or unexpected outcomes could happen.

Carefully read the annotations in the scripts.

Install the packages called throughout the scripts as needed.

IMPORTANT: Set 'M&M project raw data' as the working directory for all analyses, except for script number 10.
